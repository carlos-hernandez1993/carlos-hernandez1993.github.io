I'm Carlos, a data scientist and data analyst with previous studies in Geology and Geochemistry.

I wish build bridges between people and information and use the power of Data to improve decision-making processes.

My studies have allowed me to have analytical and methodical thinking when facing different problems, always trying to reach a good solution.
