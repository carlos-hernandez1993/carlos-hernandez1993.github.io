title: EDA - Attendance at Sporting Events

---

The theme chosen for the EDA is attendance at sporting events in the countries of the European Union (EU). This theme was selected, since being always linked to the world of sport, I wanted to understand what are the reasons that condition attendance or not at these events.

The business of sport depends on the volume of spectators that elite competitions attract. The European Union (EU) is one of the largest markets in this segment after the United States, but attendance at sporting events is uneven across Europe.

## Data

The data sources for the project were: Eurostat, epdata, Ministerio de Educaci√≥n, Cultura y Deporte (Spain).

From these sources, i could obtain:
-Reasons for non-participation in sporting events in the last 12 months.
-Frequency of participation in these events by type of household, educational level, age, sex.
-Minimum wages in the EU in purchasing power parity in 2021.
-Type of attendance at events in Spain.
-Most followed sports in Spain.
