title: EDA - Attendance at Sporting Events

---

The theme chosen for the EDA is attendance at sporting events in the countries of the European Union (EU). This theme was selected, since being always linked to the world of sport, I wanted to understand what are the reasons that condition attendance or not at these events.

The business of sport depends on the volume of spectators that elite competitions attract. The European Union (EU) is one of the largest markets in this segment after the United States, but attendance at sporting events is uneven across Europe.

## Data

The data sources for the project were: Eurostat, epdata, Ministerio de Educaci√≥n, Cultura y Deporte (Spain).

From these sources, i could obtain:

-Reasons for non-participation in sporting events in the last 12 months.

-Frequency of participation in these events by type of household, educational level, age, sex.

-Minimum wages in the EU in purchasing power parity in 2021.

-Type of attendance at events in Spain.

-Most followed sports in Spain.

## Data Processing

When working with a large number of files, columns and rows have to be equivalent. A cleaning of the data was carried out. It was done: deletion of columns and rows, rename of columns, change of string variables to numeric, merge.

## Data Analysis

In the countries of the European Union (EU), sports interest is being lost. However, I wanted to focus on the financial reasons why people don't attend these events.

Top 5 countries where the financial reason for not attending sporting events is greater.

There is a relation between financial reasons and minimum wage in purchasing power parity.

It can be seen how the education level of people is related to attendance. Usually People with Bachelor Degree have a purchasing power higher than people without bachelor degree.

The type of attendance to these events is much higher virtually than physically. Financial reasons have an impact on this variable, people's economy leads them to follow these sporting events through radio, TV or the Internet.

## Conclusion

People's purchasing power is related to attendance at sporting events, where education level, age, gender and marital status have an important and direct influence.
